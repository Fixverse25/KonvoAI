# ðŸš€ KonvoAI Quick Start for AI Assistants

## âœ¨ **Super Simple - Just One Prompt:**

```
Read CLAUDE.md and help me with: [YOUR SPECIFIC TASK HERE]
```

**That's it!** CLAUDE.md now instructs AI assistants to automatically read PROJECT_STATUS.md and DAILY_LOG.md too.

## Alternative Prompts:

```
Load KonvoAI context from CLAUDE.md, then help with: [TASK]
```

## For Complex Tasks:

```
I'm working on KonvoAI (Swedish EV charging support system). Please:
1. Read CLAUDE.md for project context and rules
2. Read PROJECT_STATUS.md for current implementation status
3. Help me [SPECIFIC TASK - e.g., "connect frontend chat to backend API"]
```

# 📅 KonvoAI - Daily Development Log

> **Context Engineering**: This file tracks specific daily changes for AI assistants to understand recent progress and current context.

## 🗓️ **July 8, 2025**

### ✅ **Completed Today:**
1. **Context Engineering Optimization**
   - Transformed misleading TASK.md into accurate PROJECT_STATUS.md
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with mandatory PROJECT_STATUS.md reading instruction
   - Created quick-start.md for simplified AI assistant onboarding
   - Added development constraints and gotchas to CLAUDE.md

2. **Security Audit & Cleanup**
   - Conducted comprehensive API key security scan across all files
   - Confirmed API keys only exist in .env file (properly gitignored)
   - Verified no sensitive credentials in git history
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with strict "NEVER add API keys to files" rule

3. **Project Status Documentation**
   - Documented actual implementation status vs. template tasks
   - Identified that backend is 80% complete and fully functional
   - Clarified that main gap is frontend-backend API integration
   - Created actionable priority list with specific file paths and code examples

4. **Daily Development Log System**
   - Created DAILY_LOG.md for tracking daily progress and context
   - Updated CLAUDE.md to automatically read DAILY_LOG.md in new sessions
   - Established end-of-session update workflow
   - Optimized context engineering for maximum AI assistant productivity

### 🔍 **Key Discoveries:**
- Backend services (Claude, Azure Speech, GDPR, Redis) are fully implemented and working
- Frontend chat widget exists but needs API integration in `frontend/public/script.js`
- Voice backend is complete, but frontend voice controls are missing
- System is much closer to completion than initially apparent

### 🎯 **Current Focus:**
- **Next Priority**: Frontend-Backend API integration (2-3 hours estimated)
- **Blocking Issue**: Chat UI not connected to `/api/v1/chat` endpoint
- **Secondary**: Voice UI implementation (backend ready, frontend missing)

### 📁 **Files Modified Today:**
- `TASK.md` → `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (complete rewrite with accurate status)
- `CLAUDE.md` (added mandatory reading instructions, context optimization, daily log integration)
- `quick-start.md` (created for AI assistant onboarding)
- `DAILY_LOG.md` (created comprehensive daily tracking system)

### 🧠 **Context for Tomorrow:**
- **Context Engineering Complete**: AI assistants now get full context with single "read CLAUDE.md" prompt
- **System Status Clear**: Backend fully functional, frontend needs API integration
- **Daily Tracking Active**: Progress and discoveries will be logged for continuity
- **Security Verified**: All API keys properly secured, no exposure risks
- **Next Session Ready**: Clear priorities and actionable steps documented

### 🚨 **Important Notes:**
- **Context Loading Optimized**: CLAUDE.md → PROJECT_STATUS.md → DAILY_LOG.md automatic sequence
- **API Security Enforced**: Strict rule against API keys in any files except .env
- **Swedish Priority Maintained**: All development follows Swedish-first approach
- **GDPR Compliance Active**: Framework implemented and working
- **No React Constraint**: Frontend is vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only

### 🎯 **Major Achievement Today:**
**Context Engineering System Complete** - Any AI assistant can now be immediately productive with optimal context loading, accurate project status, and daily progress tracking.
